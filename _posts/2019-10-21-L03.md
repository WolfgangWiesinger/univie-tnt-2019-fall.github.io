# Goals

Learning about version control systems and how they help in the development of DH projects, which are often a lengthy and complex, and require organic collaboration. 

# Software & Other Required Materials

* Make sure to create a github account (<https://github.com/>), if you do not have one.
* Download and install `git` software:
	* for Windows:
		* you can download it from <https://git-scm.com/download/win>. Please, choose **64-bit Git for Windows Setup**.
			* you can also install a portable version of `git` which does not require installation <https://git-scm.com/download/win>. For this, choose **64-bit Git for Windows Portable**. Simply download and unzip (*Suggestion*: move that unzipped folder to the folder where you keep all class-related files and materials). In the folder, run `git-bash.exe` (for a more Unix-like command line) or `git-cmd.exe` (for Windows command line).
	* for Mac: try to run `git --version` from Terminal. If `git` is not installed, you will be prompted to install `Xcode Command Line Tools` which comes with `git` among other things. This is the easiest way.
	* **Note:** there are also interface tools for *github*. We will not be working with them in the class, but you are welcome to test them on your own at home. See, <https://desktop.github.com>. The main reason for this is because interface tools will be different for different operating systems, while the command line usage will be exactly the same across all platforms.

# In Class

* Basic `git` functionality;
* Starting a `github`-based website;
* Basics of `markdown`;

## General `git` workflow:

* *In `Terminal` (on Mac) or `Git-Bash` (on Windows)*
	1. `fork` a repository (**NB:** this is done on <https://github.com>)
	2. `clone` (**NB:** this is done on <https://github.com>!)
	3. *work*
	4. `add`
	5. `commit`
	6. `push` / `pull`
	7. send `pull request` (**NB:** this is done on <https://github.com>)

**Note:** Steps 1 and 7 are relevant only when you work on a project (*repository*) that is owned by somebody else. If you work on a *repository* that you created under your account, you only need steps 2-6.

## Main `git` Commands

* `git clone <link>`
	- clones/downloads a repository on you machine
* `git status`
	- shows the current status of the repository (new, changed, deleted)
* `git add .`
	- adds all new files and modified files to the repository
* `git commit -m "message"`
	- saves all files in their current state into the repository, and created a milestone
* `git push origin master`
	- uploads changes to <https://github.com>
	- **NB:** sometimes you may get an error, which in most cases means that you need to `pull` first
* `git pull origin master`
	- downloads changes from <https://github.com>
* `git log`
	- shows the history of `commit`s; here you can choose where you want to roll back, in case of troubles

## Some useful command line commands

* `pwd`
	- shows you where you are on a drive (gives you path)
* `ls` / `dir` [on Windows]
	- shows everything in the your current location/folder
* `cd <name of the folder>`
	- takes you to that folder
* `cd ..` 
	- takes you one level up in the tree structure of your computer

# Homework

* Make sure to work through the readings given in the *Reference materials* above. They include all you need to know to complete the homework assignment.
* Your main assignment is to build your website on <https://github.com>.
	* You can use this template <https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll> (the page also includes step-by-step instructions.
		* You are encouraged to use other themes as well. Check, for example, <https://jekyllthemes.io/> or <http://jekyllthemes.org/>. Or, ask Google. 
	* Brief instructions (more details can be found in Visconti's tutorial (see above), and on the page of the suggested template)
		* `fork`
		* create a repository under your account with the name: `username.github.io`, where username is your github username; the repository with such names are automatically treated by github as a website.
		* copy all files from the forked repository into your new one (`clone` > `copy/paste`).
		* README.md has all the instructions on how to make modifications to your site; play with those!
		* you can pick a different theme for you site (just google `jekyll themes` for options).
* Complete the markdown tutorial @ <https://www.markdowntutorial.com/>. This will help you to write pages on your website. 

## Submitting homework:

* Homework assignment must be submitted by the beginning of the next class;
* Email your homework to the instructor.
	* if your homework is to create a file, email it as an attachment
	* if your homework is a blogpost on your website, email the link to your website and to the blogpost with your homework.
	*  In the subject of your email, please, add the following: `070112-LXX-HW-YourLastName-YourMatriculationNumber`, where `LXX` is the lesson for which the homework is submitted, `YourLastName` is your last name, and `YourMatriculationNumber` is your matriculation number.
